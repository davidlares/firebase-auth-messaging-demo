## Firebase Auth messaging demo

This is a demo project to demonstrate the use of Google Firebase's Authentication, Hosting, FCM, and Database modules, as well as some features using its native JavaScript methods.

## Prerequisites

- Generate a project within the Firebase console
- Enter the correct credentials in the firebase.js file
- Enable email authentication options within the Firebase project

## Usage

It can run in any local environment or server, on Apache, Nginx, or their derivatives
```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
